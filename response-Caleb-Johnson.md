I think that this is a fun idea to explore many of the concepts of database design, and would be a fun communal platform for players to share experiences and more.


## Business

We would need to keep it free and open-source like you mentioned. Services such as Serebii have operated on this platform and have found success.

## Legal

Nintendo does have a history of shutting down projects that infringe on intellectual property, such as fan-games and ROM hacks, but this service as I understand it doesn't seem to.  As long as it is a communal service to bring information and experiences together I do not think there would be any problems.

## Technical

I  agree with many of your points, and a concise database design will be very helpful in creating this application.
